## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a multiclass classification model using PyTorch to predict Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four input features. The model is trained to classify each flower into one of the three species.

## Description
The dataset used is the Iris Dataset, which contains 150 samples and 4 features:

-Sepal Length (cm)
-Sepal Width (cm)
-Petal Length (cm)
-Petal Width (cm)
-The target variable (species) is categorical:

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica

## Steps to Run the Code
1-Install the required libraries: torch, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.
2-Download the dataset (iris.csv) and place it in your working directory.
3-Open the provided .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
4-Run all cells to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate the results.
5-View the generated plots for training/validation loss and ROC curves for each class.
